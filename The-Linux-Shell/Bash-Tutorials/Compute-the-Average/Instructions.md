# Problem Statement

Given N integers, compute their average, correct to three decimal places.

## Input Format 

  > The first line contains an integer N. 

  > This is followed by N integers, each on a new line.

## Output Format 

Display the average of the N integers, rounded off to three decimal places.

## Input Constraints 

  > 1 <= N <= 500 

  > -10000 <= x <= 10000 (x refers to elements of the list of integers for which the average is to be computed)

## Sample Input

```
4

1

2

9

8
```

## Sample Output

`5.000`

### Explanation 

The `4` in the first line indicates that there are four integers whose average is to be computed. 

The `average = (1 + 2 + 9 + 8)/4 = 20/4 = 5.000` (correct to three decimal places) 

Please include the zeroes even if they are redundant (eg. 0.000 instead of 0).
