# Problem Statement: Comparing Numbers

Given two integers X and Y, identify whether "X is less than Y" or "X is greater than Y" or "X is equal to Y".

Comparisons in a shell script, may either be accomplished using regular operators (such as < or >) or using (-lt, -gt, -eq i.e. less than, greater than, equal to) for POSIX shells. This discussion on stack overflow contains useful information on this topic.

## Input Format 

Two lines containing one integer each (X and Y)

## Output Format 

Exactly one of the following lines "X is less than Y" or "X is greater than Y" or "X is equal to Y".

## Sample Input 1

  > 5
  
  > 2
  
## Sample Output 1

X is greater than Y  

## Sample Input 2

  > 2
  
  > 2
  
## Sample Output 2

X is equal to Y   

## Sample Input 3

  > 2

  > 3
