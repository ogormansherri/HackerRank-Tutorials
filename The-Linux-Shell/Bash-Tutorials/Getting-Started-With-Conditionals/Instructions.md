# Problem Statement

'If' Statements in Bash are often used in four important ways:

```1. if...then...fi statements
2. if...then...else...fi statements  
3. if..elif..else..fi  
4. if..then..else..if..then..fi..fi.. (Nested Conditionals)``

The 'Recommended Resources' may give you a clearer idea of conditionals in bash.
