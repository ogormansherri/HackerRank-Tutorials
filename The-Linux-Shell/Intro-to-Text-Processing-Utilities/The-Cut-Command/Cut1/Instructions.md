# Create Text Processing in Linux - The Cut Command - #1

## Problem Statement

### Task

Display the third character from each line of text.

### Input Format

A text file with lines of ASCII text only.

### Input Constraints 

1 <= N <= 100 (N is the number of lines of text in the input file) 

### Note: These values don't really impact your command.

### Output Format

* The output should contain N lines. 
* Each line should contain just the third character of the corresponding input line. 
* Do not code defensively for situations where the third character may not be present in a line of text (i.e., it is not even 3 characters long).
